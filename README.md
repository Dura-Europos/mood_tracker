# For Developers: How is this app built and how to play with it

High level ideas:
- Minimal UI friction: Just a dropdown and a note field to log the mood
- Lightweight backend: Google Sheets avoids spinning up a full database. Also connection is cached so that if the tab reopens, it doesn't require another connection 
- Fast feedback loop: Visuals update instantly (plus button to refresh manually) to give a sense of progress
- Separation of concerns: one section for input, one for visualization.

UX Touches:
- Success/warning messages
- Manual refresh button
- Emoji + label formatting for clarity
- Raw data view for transparency
